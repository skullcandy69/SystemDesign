# Hotel Management LLD
We need to design an online hotel booking system where a user can search a hotel in a given city and book it. This is an OOP design question, so I have not written the full code in this solution. I have created the classes and attributes only.
Solution :
Main Classes :
1. User 
2. Room 
3. Hotel 
4. Booking 
5. Address 
6. Facilities
